Welcome to My Portfolio ! 


My Name is Victoire Intwali Igisubizo. I am proud to say that I coded my own portfolio. It wasn't an easy process but I was glad to do it. 

In this project I encountered challenges, proud cheerful screams, and relief. I wouldn't take any of it back.
My Portfolio as you can see provides a little insight on who Iam as a creative. I am a creative who likes to tell a story through their work. I am creative who is still learning and developing as life moves forward.



Let me take you through my thought process as I created this website. 


I started this project with a clear vision: to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly portfolio that reflects my personality and professional journey. My first step was planningâ€”sketching and mapping out the content I wanted to include. Once I was satisfied with the layout and design, I moved on to the colours and typography. 



Colours. 

- I chose dark blue tones 
- Peach tones 
- Red tones 

I chose these colour combinations because they evoke a sense of trust from a client. Dark blue brings out the sense of peace and professionalism.  Red for hovering and links because it draws the clients attention to more things I have to offer. Finally, I chose peach to blend these two powerful colours together without overpowering the eyes of my clients. 




Typography. 

- On my website I used Calibri and sans serif because they are bold and calm without making it hard for the clients to see. 
- Another reason I chose it was because It didn't take away from the images and content on the page. It was not distracting or overpowering. 




Challenges. 

Honestly my first and biggest challenge was reaserching all the time who to use bootstrap. I was so used to using CSS for most of the designing and outlining. This was the first project where most of my code was Bootstrap. Going back and forth from my sketches and to bringing it to life with bootsrap was definitely a challenge. 




Solutions. 

With this being my biggest challenge, there was no shortcut I could take except to research and do the hard work.
- I used youtube videos, getbootsrap.com
After a while I started to get the hang of it. 




Lessons Learned.

- The biggest lesson I learned was to explore outside your comfort zone. 
- Patience was key to achieve what I had put down on that piece of paper. 
- Persistence and not giving up: It is very easy to give up when things don't immediately work out, but when you persist and do your best it really does show in your work.

Conclusion

Building this website was a truly one of a kind experience, It taught me a lot and it challenged me to grow as a developer. I hope you enjoyed exploring my work.
